INSTALL
-------

Requirements: 

* Haskell platform, version 2014.2.0.0. See
  https://www.haskell.org/platform/ to download the software and for
  installation instructions.

  After installation: make sure that you are using alex and happy from the
  platform (and not some older versions in your PATH)
   
* Cabal 1.20. By default, the platform has Cabal version 1.18, so you need
  to install the newer cabal version by hand:
  
  - Run 'cabal update'
  - Run 'cabal install cabal-install' (may take some time)
  - Make sure that invoking 'cabal --version' indicates that you are using
    version 1.20.* of cabal

Preparations:

* Make sure you are in the 'server' subdirectory of this project (the same
  directory as this file resides in)
* Run 'cabal sandbox init'
* Run 'cabal install --only-dependencies' (may take some time)
* Run 'chmod 755 prepare shake'
* Run './prepare'

Building:

* Run './shake MessageQueueRecvClient MessageQueueSendClient MessageQueueServer MessageQueueTests'
