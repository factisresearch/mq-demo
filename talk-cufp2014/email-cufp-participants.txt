Hello everyone and welcome to the CUFP 2014 tutorial "Haskell in the Real World"!

We are sending you some instructions on how to setup the software for the
"Haskell in the Real World" tutorial. Please make sure to bring a laptop
with all required software already installed. We don't want to waste our
time during the tutorial troubleshooting installation issues.

The source code for the tutorial is at github. Please clone the repository
first:

$ git clone https://github.com/factisresearch/mq-demo.git

The repository contains all further installation instructions, have a look
at the file server/README. A short summary is

* You need the *latest* Haskell platform with GHC 7.8.3
* You need cabal version 1.20 (not included in the platform)
* You need additional Haskell packages.

As said, all details are in server/README. Please make sure that you
execute all installation steps. At the end, you should be able to run the
various programs as follows:

# start a message server
$ scripts/run MessageQueueServer 9876 STORE @queue1 queue2 --loglevels=DEFAULT:DEBUG

# start a client for receiving messages
$ scripts/run MessageQueueRecvClient 127.0.0.1 9876 queue1

# send some messages
$ scripts/run MessageQueueSendClient 127.0.0.1 9876 queue1 msg-id bar

# run the tests
$ scripts/run MessageQueueTests

If you encounter any problems, please report these as issues of the github
project at https://github.com/factisresearch/mq-demo/issues. You can also
write me an email, my address is wehr@cp-med.com.

See you all in Gothenburg next week!

Kind regards,
Stefan Wehr and Emin Karayel
